by not paying for a subscription. It is cheaper for a company
to


## Overview of the project

Most data science projecst follow a standard pattern.

* selection of the data set. There are
* exploratory data visualisations
* building the classifier for churn prediction. This includes tuning the hyperparameters of the classifier. If the classes are imbalanced, then spacialised
techniques need
* evaluate the classifier with metrics, such as the confusion matrix, accuracy, precision and recall.
* compare the results to the results in the literature
