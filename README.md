# Project on developing a classifier to predict customer churn

Customer churn occurs when a customer leaves a company
by not paying for a subscription. It is cheaper for a company
to keep customers than to gain new customer.

The project can be done using R or python.

## Overview of the project

Most data science projects follow a standard pattern.

* selection of the data set. There are some possible options below.
* exploratory data visualizations
* building the classifier for churn prediction. This includes tuning the hyper-parameters of the classifier. If the classes are imbalanced, then specialized
techniques need
* evaluate the classifier with metrics, such as the confusion matrix, accuracy, precision and recall.
* compare the results to the results in the literature

## Churn datasets

* [Bank customer churn](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mathchi/churn-for-bank-customers)

##  Final part of the project

* Explainability
* Errors on the classifiers

## Errors on the predictions 

* Investigate the use of [Conformal prediction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conformal_prediction) to compute the error on the classifier.
* The [mapie library](https://mapie.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) implements conformal prediction.
